Pigs When young up to being kild for bacon
When they are young you have to wate 3 days then you can injeck them for pneumonia diseases
you have mack shore they have drye straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a falk in with them because the mother might nock it down and the little pigs might stab themselves
we give the worme pouder
that is when they get the worme
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can ge out of the way of there mother
some people put a light in with theme to geep them warm
you have to make shore that mother has a lot of milk
If she as not got enough milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they came eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts of fating
they can eate some meal when they get a little biger
we give them some fating food called Nomber 2
whe you wean that is take them from their mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little wones
fighting
when they and bing you have to see about waying

The Jordan family were once a happy crowd
The family of six lifd in a counsel house Just outside Londen But something whenet wrong
Mother and father were always shouting at each other the people across the street could hear them figthing the children would cry Tommy was the oldest he was 12 he was more groon up that than the others
Jane was 8 she was frightened of her mum and dad Jone was 5 and Alan 1 1/2 years
He was to young to to understand he was crying all the time nevertheless

It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly diad
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook
I still have the photo
The brook was about 8 feet wide
The water was about 2 feet deep
But they was 6 feet off wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in I went
I slolly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister stoped and saved my life she held my head above water untill my sisters got home and told my parents
then they raced down to the brook dad have a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually his got me out and carred me home

I'm am never alloud to sit up and watch programes not surtebull for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, they was a film on TV unfitt for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and killing, men were being hung and other were being shot or stabed

My work on a farm I have live on a farm all off my life, I am not bosting but I think I know a fair bit about farming
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery
Some people say farming is the lowest payed and hardest working imployment out
I agree with those people
but I would rather work for my living, than just siting in a stufy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do
Give me the open air life
My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I leave school
I am going to take my apprentiship course when I leave at easter
that means that I go to classis ones a week
I will learn a lot more about farming and if I pull through the course I will be a usfull chap about the farm
Will I am taking my course I will be get 17 shilling less than the boy worker that is not taking the course
But when I am 17 and finished my Apprentiship I will get 10% more than the average pay off a boy my age
Many people asked me why I have choosen farming as my future carrer
(1) I will be in the open air
(2) I will be doing a diffrent Job every day (3) I am not interested in enthing else
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been work on the farm in the holidays
And I can tell the men I have worked with have been good and give me a few tips
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I life school
So if anybody want an open air life, choose FARMING

As I looked at this picture it made me think the people were druck
The people throw the thinks on the floor
The woman put the baby in the chair in the corner so that they can have a sleep
They opened the window to let the fresh air in
This picture we panted in the olden days
It was dark in the house but not outside
It looks to me as if it was raining
The dog is licking up the scraps
The bird is up in his cage wondering what is happing
Look at the old fashion shoes
They socks come up to the top of they legs like long grandpa's pants
One of the children are playing with the fire

When a woman looks in her Pram
One day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping
She went into the shop to order her weekly meat, of course she left her baby outside the shop
Her baby was still sitting her its pram, but the little baby was crying
the little baby could not talk much he could say little words
His Mum said to him "Now what are you crying for My little baby, "he keep on "Man, Man,", he meant that Man which were going down the road, at first she could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram And a woman came over the road a said "you better watch were you leave you baby misses" the baby's mothers said "why" so the other lady" said, "because you know that old man which as Just gone down the road, well he tried to take your little baby out of its pram
So she said "thank you very much for telling me, and said "goodbye So the lady walk on with her baby
This time she went into the baker's to get some bread
The old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger, which was just aside the  baker's
The Lady went in, and while she was in the man changed babys
So he had the white one and she had the black one, of course he ran away, no one saw him
She came out of the Baker's and looked in her pram a saw the baby asleep
She went home a while the baby was asleep she done some jobs
When she had done her jobs she said to herself "the babys is having a long sleep
I go and see if he is still asleep
She opened the down and she sow a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted
after she had shouted she put on her coat and went and phone the police
The police said they would be here in a very few minetes
As soon as she had a knock on the door, she said "Come in," it was the policemen
The police said, "What can we do for you Miss
So she said "This is not my baby I had a white one so the police said when did you first find out she said just a minute ago
Just before before I phoned you
One of the police said "did you leave it outside a shop, and she said "yes while I went in the  baker's
(she was crying) The other policeman said
"tell us the whole story" So she told them to sit down aud asked them if they wanted a cup of tea they said yes
So she put on the kettle and then sat down and told then the story about her baby
And the police said they would try and find her own baby
The very long days went by and still they couldn't find the baby, but after a while the police heard a little about the baby

AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
when you go scrumping you have got to be carefull you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears
when you go pinching apple you do not want to take to many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you especially little boys they make too much noise
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be carful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump wherever it stings you
when you are by yourself and someone comes and you have to climb over the barb wire and get caught the man will probally catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you
some people when the catch you they might hit you and said he will hit you harder next time he catches you
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be reconnised very easy because red shows up very easy
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples

The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make another savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze
he's gone to collect his meal
He makes a leap
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal

WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song
The leaves have gone
It will not be long before the tree has gone

Stranden on a Desert Island
One midsummer day at 930 am
a ship was wrecked by a corral reef so people jumped overboard
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfits
So one man volonteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room
Their were dead bodys on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreck
Their were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water
As he open the store room door the water gushed in very quickly
So he had to feel for the diving suits
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent to men to help him
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on the went down to get some food
Luckily enough it was mostly tin food
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island
When looking around the deck they saw a lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in
They all had one tin of something each
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested
There was about 35 on the island but people who used to get coconuts usally got lost or got bitten by a snake
They had shortend done from 35 to 15
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to
And they could also catch fish to eat
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they kill animals and drank fresh water from springs
they found here and there
they found coconuts while hunting for animals
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the gound and sticks laide across with grass on top of them
At night they slept all together under coconut trees
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted
As soon ass they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again

LEAVING SCHOOL
When I leav school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's at Mording
I work up there at weekend and in the holidays
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people
They have a farm attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a meadow
They have a tractor and a trailer
They are two brothers Frank and John
John is my boss
Frank has four cars two which go and two which do not go
John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one effer

THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs out with John, then the lorry
Then we go back down the yard and unload the dung
Then I started the tractor up again , and went out on too the fild
Then we uncovered some manggles , and loaded them up we got three loades before dinner from about 1130 until about 1 o'clock
When we come back from dinner we started the tractor up again and went for another load, we got for more loades before tea the last one we go stuck with
But we soon got out of theat when John put some bricks under the wheels This is the tractor witch I drive at weekends , and in the holidays
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to TVO
Then away you go
It is a low gird tractor it has three fowd girse and 1 reveirse
It has for silinders and a hydraulic lift the manifold as burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the botton of it

I want to get married at 20, so that I will have about three years to get engaged, and to get to know each other
I wand two children, one of each or twins
I also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown wavey hair not much taller than me
I want a man that likes children and takes them out, and plays with them
Then we will all be able to go out and enjoy ourselves
I shall stop nursing when I get married, after I have had a child, then I may do part-time work
I want to get married in white
I want to go abroad for my honeymoon
For the first summer holiday, I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram

Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands
So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of it until the film was over
the best boyfriend I ever had
his father was posted
and so Stephen left
But we still send letters and postcards to each other
So that we still remember each other

One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee, but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened, and told me to take the baby down to the Police station
So I got ready and set off to the station
Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the Police
They said that they would put up notices about the baby
They let me look after him until someone owned up
A month later
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to, if not they would put it in a home
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few days' time the baby was ours and weren't we pleased
So we all lived happily ever after
The End

When I am a children's Nurse
When I get the Job of a children's nurse, I shall be very happy I'm sure, There will be lots of other nurses there to help look after the children we have to put the children to bed, and get them dressed, give them there food, and toys to play
I like looking after young children, I will be able to get home now and then, and see may parents
If one of the children decide that they want to run away then of course we must go and look for them, and bring them back

IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS
One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and takeing my friend for a walk
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day

Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the meal

they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true

Because it's night time and dark
Because the wind is wild
Because the two waves are a ring
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and there

They ran away to get married In a little country called Lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother, father, maids, and four children, the eldest, was Jenny who was 18 years of age, she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12, Jenny had a boyfriend who live a few yards away from her, his name was Johnny he was 20 years of age
Jenny and Johnny wanted to get marreid , they had known each other for 6 years, and were very much in love
They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a married home
But thee only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent, to the marriage
So the two young children decided to ran away and get married
So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30
So one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clock and made their way to the station
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast
Soon they were on the train
Now we needn't worry about anythink my darling, said Johnny
No we can get a job in London and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said Jenny
yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to London
2 months pass They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got married  in a registery office and after the celebrate until 12 o'clock that night, then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went and rang on Jenny's doorbell first
he father came to the door, and took one look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married that's why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office
so "said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but I do wish you'd told us all because I think you are old enough to be man and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home
you can live here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad, and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch youre parents Johnny, and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and celebrated
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl, and they all lived happily ever after

Dear Les,
I hope you are OK
just a few lines to write about our English lesson with Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months
He has taught us how to write good letters, stories, and poems
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years
But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work
Love and best wishes, Judith

Then there was my mother and father and I came out of the house that night and saw that the cats were in the hole making a noise but we couldn't do anything about it because it was to late
But have got over it

My mother and father have been married for ten years and they have been happy ever since
When they started to meet
They said shall we go to the pictures and my mother said yes we'll do that said my mother it is a very good idea
But sometimes they have a fight they had a fight last night but they made friends again then when we went out last Saturday afternoon they started to have a fight

Sir,
Mr T says Mr Holbrook is to soft with us by not teaching us spellings
I agree with Mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words differcult but people who get under 40 find words very differcult
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy
William Glebe

Sir,
Mr T says that Mr Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and doesn't teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is absolutly nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them
Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we consantrate , and listern to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world
When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the spellings, and puntuation
Yours faithfully Judith

When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea you're tinking of
Jack O'Malley

we have to work hard, and it tacks hard work to write thoese story and it very hard when people say he soft on us
Joan Stall

I think Mr T shoold come and see Mr
Holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a frame magazine
