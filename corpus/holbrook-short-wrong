this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can ge out of the way of there mother
some people put a light in with theme to geep them warm
you have to make shore that mother has a lot of milk
If she as not got enough milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
