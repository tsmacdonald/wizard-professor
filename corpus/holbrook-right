THE SICK SOW OF THE ARMY COURT
One day Sergent S M Bullimore told Hut 29 to clean Cynthia's pig sty out
When Hut 29 got there they had to go and get some gas masks because the smell was to strong
When S M Bullimore came to the pig sty the pig was laid out on the floor
when they came back S M Bullimore said what have you been doing to my sow
we have not done anything we had to go and get some gas masks because the smell was too strong
that is only the soap what I wash it with
perhaps he ate some soap
Flogger said shall I go and get the vet
get back in the line before I put you on charge
Flogger said under his breath `go and have a pony run'
what did you say
o nothing sir
go and get some whiskey
okay sir
put some soap in it Flogger said Oswald
OK said Flogger
Flogger went off
a little while after he came with a large soap whiskey
he gave it to S M Bullimore
Then he gave it to the pig
A little while after the pig got up and there beside her were six little pigs
S M Bullimore said that made her better that was not me that was the soap
you are on charge
what did you give her
I gave her some whiskey and soap you gave her that
no I never I sir
you did
that's one thing sir It has made her better

Pigs When young up to being killed for bacon
When they are young you have to wait 3 days then you can inject them for pneumonia diseases
you have make sure they have dry straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a fork in with them because the mother might knock it down and the little pigs might stab themselves
we give them worm powder
that is when they get the worm
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can get out of the way of their mother
some people put a light in with them to keep them warm
you have to make sure that mother has a lot of milk
If she has not got enough milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they can eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts for fattening
they can eat some meal when they get a little bigger
we give them some fattening food called Nomber 2
when you wean that is take them from their mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little ones
fighting
when they are big you have to see about weighing
when they have been weighed and ready to go away to be killed

Billy Bunter was too large So they sent for Him in charge
Him in charge was too thin So they sent for Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin heart is poor So they sent for Barbra Moore
Barbra Moore was having dinner So they sent for Yule Brinner
Yule Brinner sang too high Then they went to space in the sky

My heart is full of sadness My heart is full of joy It might be my wife Or it might be Helen of Troy

One Saturday I thought I would go to the Races at London
I went on my Royal Enfield
they can go quite fast
this was a Royal Enfield ?
there were some Royal Enfield Racing there as well
I saw a Royal Enfield come first it was like mine
there were the new Japanese Honda
they are very fast and getting quite popular in England
I saw one man come off
he was on a BSA
One man had to go in Hospital because he broke his leg
another man hurt his arm in a sidecar race
I don't think it was much
I saw a sidecar turn right over
the sidecar man was alright but the motorbike Rider was thrown into the crowd
I don't know what happened to him
he was hurt quite bad
the sidecar broke off the motorbike and spun down the track for 7 yards then hit a man who was on the corner and killed him
his hat was blowing down the track
the motorbike caught fire and blew up
the petrol went all over the track but they soon put it out by sand
there was some oil got on the track as well
it made it very slippery
There were quite a few people there because it was a nice dry day
The final race was on
there were 2 Royal Enfield 3 Japanese Honda 1 BSA
3 Triumph
they were on the starting line
Bang they're off
one BSA is still on the starting line the rest are round the bend
I can see one man off
he is on a Triumph
I think a Japanese Honda is in the lead
I think he is going to lead
he's won by 3 yards and a Royal Enfield 2 and a Honda 3
The End

we went over the football field it was quite wet and soon made my toes cold
the grass was quite long now it shone with the dew on it
a field ploughed next to it I think it was done yesterday
on the other side was a hedge
it had a lot of thorns in it
they had cleaned the river and made it very wide for the ducks
there were some potatoes in the water
there were some brussels men sitting in the pathway round a fire
we had to go on to a ploughed field to get round them this made my shoes heavy
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did I but we still went
the dew on the brussels leaves made them like pearls
Mr Holbrook went over the brook first
some were boys going round but only one went
after all the rest went over the tree Gerald nearly went in
one foot touched the water
then we went across the new piece of grass into school
we went and cleaned our shoes with paper
then the bell went for break

A poem A little yellow bird sat on my window sill He hopped
and popped about He whistled he chirped
I tried to catch my little yellow bird but he flew in to the golden yellow sun, O how I wish that was my yellow bird

Apple red and green start are bright The apple trees are tall The leaves are small The apples
fall in autumn time
When you get to the cores inside the cores are pips you throw the cores on the fire to burn then
the boys in our village go in the orchard and climb the trees and pinch them
all then they run away with them
then the earwigs fall out in their pockets
the apples are sweet
the trees are full of apples
some of them are cookers
the apples are so gay hanging on the trees
with the sun on them
no wonder the boys like pinch them

What I am going to do when I leave school
When I leave I want to be a hairdresser in Melton or Tonbury

When I have children I am going to leave work and the husband has got to like children and take them out
I want twins
and I want four bridesmaids
I want to live in a bungalow
for my holiday I would like to go to Butlins , for a honeymoon I like to go to Scotland

Swan upping
When they do this kind of thing they need calmer waters
they have to handle them very carefully They use small Boats people think this is very cruel to catch them and put stamp on their wings, in this picture there is a man carrying one out of the Boat its Wings are tied so that it can not break the man's arms, the swans are delicate things

Poem
one day the sun was out and up the stairs I went
My mother in a temper, I spent my day in bed
for fear of my mother I daren't go near
For fear I didn't get to see the sun,
There she lays So quietly there Waiting for the day People weeping waiting Sighing all the days Their hearts are weeping Crying so Hearts beating so rapidly

The Jordan family were once a happy crowd
The family of six lived in a council house Just outside London But something went wrong
Mother and father were always shouting at each other the people across the street could hear them fighting the children would cry Tommy was the oldest he was 12 he was more grown up that than the others
Jane was 8 she was frightened of her mum and dad Joan was 5 and Alan 1 1/2 years
He was too young to to understand he was crying all the time nevertheless

It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly died
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook
I still have the photo
The brook was about 8 feet wide
The water was about 2 feet deep
But there was 6 feet of wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in I went
I slowly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister stopped and saved my life she held my head above water until my sisters got home and told my parents
then they raced down to the brook dad had a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually he got me out and carried me home
my clothes had to be destroyed it took seven baths to get me clean

I'm am never allowed to sit up and watch programmes not suitable for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, there was a film on TV unfit for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and killing, men were being hung and others were being shot or stabbed
men had their heads cut in half

My work on a farm I have live on a farm all of my life, I am not boasting but I think I know a fair bit about farming
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery
Some people say farming is the lowest paid and hardest working employment out
I agree with those people
but I would rather work for my living, than just sitting in a stuffy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do
Give me the open air life
My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I leave school
I am going to take my apprenticeship course when I leave at easter
that means that I go to classes once a week
I will learn a lot more about farming and if I pull through the course I will be a useful chap about the farm
While I am taking my course I will be getting 17 shillings less than the boy worker that is not taking the course
But when I am 17 and finished my Apprenticeship I will get 10% more than the average pay of a boy my age
Many people asked me why I have chosen farming as my future career
(1) I will be in the open air
(2) I will be doing a different Job every day (3) I am not interested in anything else
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been working on the farm in the holidays
And I can tell the men I have worked with have been good and given me a few tips
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I leave school
So if anybody wants an open air life, choose FARMING

Dear Rose
I hope you are alright
I am writing to tell you about my English I have done with Mr David Hollbrook
He is always making me write letters or stories
I know English will do me more good when I leave school
But sometimes I get very bored
Mind you I'm not very good at English but I try
Love and Best Wishes Ann

Dear Mr Hollbrook, I hope you will soon get better and come back to school and teach us Have you marked the Exams papers
I hope this letter will cheer you up
All the class were sorry to hear you had flu
Well soon get better yours sincerely Joan Stall and Ann Barley 3C

As I looked at this picture it made me think the people were drunk
The people throw the things on the floor
The woman put the baby in the chair in the corner so that they can have a sleep
They opened the window to let the fresh air in
This picture was painted in the olden days
It was dark in the house but not outside
It looks to me as if it was raining
The dog is licking up the scraps
The bird is up in his cage wondering what is happening
Look at the old fashioned shoes
Their socks come up to the top of their legs like long grandpa's pants
One of the children are playing with the fire

When a woman looks in her Pram
One day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping
She went into the shop to order her weekly meat, of course she left her baby outside the shop
Her baby was still sitting her its pram, but the little baby was crying
the little baby could not talk much he could say little words
His Mum said to him "Now what are you crying for My little baby, "he keep on "Man, Man,", he meant that Man which were going down the road, at first she could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram And a woman came over the road and said "you better watch where you leave your baby misses" the baby's mother said "why" so the other lady" said, "because you know that old man which has Just gone down the road, well he tried to take your little baby out of its pram
So she said "thank you very much for telling me, and said "goodbye So the lady walked on with her baby
This time she went into the baker's to get some bread
The old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger, which was just aside the  baker's
The Lady went in, and while she was in the man changed babies
So he had the white one and she had the black one, of course he ran away, no one saw him
She came out of the Baker's and looked in her pram a saw the baby asleep
She went home and while the baby was asleep she done some jobs
When she had done her jobs she said to herself "the baby is having a long sleep
I go and see if he is still asleep
She opened the door and she saw a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted
after she had shouted she put on her coat and went and phoned the police
The police said they would be here in a very few minutes
As soon as she had a knock on the door, she said "Come in," it was the policemen
The police said, "What can we do for you Miss
So she said "This is not my baby I had a white one so the police said when did you first find out she said just a minute ago
Just before before I phoned you
One of the police said "did you leave it outside a shop, and she said "yes while I went in the  baker's
(she was crying) The other policeman said
"tell us the whole story" So she told them to sit down and asked them if they wanted a cup of tea they said yes
So she put on the kettle and then sat down and told them the story about her baby
And the police said they would try and find her own baby
The very long days went by and still they couldn't find the baby, but after a while the police heard a little about the baby
The woman was very upset
And one day the two policemen came to her house holding a white baby
So the woman grabbed the baby and said thank you very much for finding him
I will give you #5 pounds reward
the policemen took the #5 pounds and shared it
And the old woman lived happy ever after and always took her own baby wherever she went

Once upon a time there were a girl who wanted to get married, but her parents wouldn't let her not until she were 20 or 21
She had a boyfriend and so did he want to get married

AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
when you go scrumping you have got to be careful you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears
when you go pinching apples you do not want to take too many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you especially little boys they make too much noise
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be careful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump wherever it stings you
when you are by yourself and someone comes and you have to climb over the barbed wire and get caught the man will probably catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you
some people when they catch you they might hit you and say he will hit you harder next time he catches you
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be recognized very easy because red shows up very easy
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples

The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make another savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze
he's gone to collect his meal
He makes a leap
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal

WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song
The leaves have gone
It will not be long before the tree has gone

Stranded on a Desert Island
One midsummer day at 930 am
a ship was wrecked by a coral reef so people jumped overboard
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfits
So one man volunteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room
There were dead bodies on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreck
There were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water
As he opened the store room door the water gushed in very quickly
So he had to feel for the diving suits
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent two men to help him
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on then went down to get some food
Lucky enough it was mostly tinned food
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island
When looking around the deck they saw a lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in
They all had one tin of something each
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested
There was about 35 on the island but people who used to get coconuts usually got lost or got bitten by a snake
They had shortened down from 35 to 15
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to
And they could also catch fish to eat
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they killed animals and drank fresh water from springs
they found here and there
they found coconuts while hunting for animals
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the ground and sticks laid across with grass on top of them
At night they slept all together under coconut trees
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted
As soon as they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again

On Saturday morning we have bullocks to kill first, after we have finished the Bullocks the men go and have their lunch, and we have to clean up, and empty the gut truck and then go and have my lunch and a fag
I go back down to the Slaughterhouse after my lunch, and nose the pigs up
by then there would be a gut on the table
I would do the gut and get a tin inside to run the guts into
Then hang the pluck up on the hook, and that goes on all Day

LEAVING SCHOOL
When I leave school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's at Mording
I work up there at weekends and in the holidays
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people
They have a farm attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a meadow
They have a tractor and a trailer
There are two brothers Frank and John
John is my boss
Frank has four cars two which go and two which do not go
John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one heifer

THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs out with John, then the lorry
Then we go back down the yard and unload the dung
Then I started the tractor up again , and went out on to the field
Then we uncovered some mangels , and loaded them up we got three loads before dinner from about 1130 until about 1 o'clock
When we come back from dinner we started the tractor up again and went for another load, we got four more loads before tea the last one we got stuck with
But we soon got out of that when John put some bricks under the wheels This is the tractor which I drive at weekends , and in the holidays
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to TVO
Then away you go
It is a low geared tractor it has three forward gears and 1 reverse
It has four cylinders and a hydraulic lift the manifold has burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the bottom of it
if you fill the radiator up with water it will last for 10 minutes because it has a hole in the bottom of it as big round as a sixpence

The Sick Sow
Last week I went up the farm and Bill told me that he had just bought a black and white sow
He said it fed all right for the first three days, but now she won't feed at all
So I said let me come and look at her , so we went and had a look at her , and she was lame on the her right, front leg
I said to Bill no wonder she does not feed very well, she is lame on her front leg
Bill said she will not feed at all , well let me see the kind of grub you give her then
So Bill showed me, I said don't you give the old girl any bran no said bill well there you are that is your trouble then I said
You give her some bran tonight and then see if she will eat it
Well I could give her some now couldn't I yes if you wish Look at that see she will eat it now yes thanks John, that's all right mate
She is in pig isn't she Bill yes she should have them on the 24th June
Well I know one thing what you want to do
What is that John, you want to clean her out and put her plenty of straw in the place where she sleeps and out in the yard

The Old Bull
One day I went round old man Jones's farm and he and some of his workmen had got the bull out in the yard
As I went in the gate the old bull started to turn on me, so old man Jones, said get behind that old cart Joe
About 4 or 5 minutes after, I came out from behind the cart
They had got the old bull back in the shed
Then he asked me if I would help him bring daisy the old cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a nothing calf
So he put her in with old Toogey the bull he got on her back and we let him stay with her for about half of an hour
About four to five month after she had been with the old bull she had a calf it was a bull calf
When it was about ten weeks old, when we sold it it made #1510s6d
Then the time came for the old bull to be sold he was too old and fat for the old cows
So we took him down tonbury market and he made #8510/6d alive he weighed one and a half tons

But when you pick it, it might have a bit of fungus you might find a bit of spur with the leaves still on or you might see an earwig just coming out of it but that doesn't mind just flick it off when you want to eat just give it a shine and dig your teeth in it and you say what a lovely taste it has very juicy and you feel a sort of tingle what makes you feel so gay

In my family there are 5 we used to have 6 but my mother died she died about 3 month ago died of her brain shrivelling up she could have died when she was a little girl but she had all of us if she would have lived she would have been blind deaf and dumb and paralysed sometimes times my father cries I don't like him crying it gets on my nerves when I doing the work my little brother is a nuisance he keeps on hitting me and kicking me when he can't get his own way but is a nice boy really and his name is steven thomas christopher

One day I went to a party they had nice things but I did not like some of the girls they didn't like me some of them but I just sat there watching them play games until someone asked me to join in then I felt a bit better then The girls were beginning to like me and in every game they asked me to join in

When Jennifer was a little girl it was toys toys toys but now she is a big girl it is boys boys boys

Apply it in little dots on the cheeks and blend in carefully otherwise it would look awful , if you don't put in on properly and people will start to talk and I tell you that isn't very nice
So I advise you to get the book about make-up because it teaches you how to make your skin lovely

One day a lady looked out of the window it was very cold and wet
She saw the milk and brought it in and on the step was a little baby oh a baby
I wonder whose it is I'll take it to the police I feed it first because it might be hungry are you poor thing don't cry you poor thing I wonder what it likes I'll give it some milk and see if it will stop crying I wonder what my husband will say when he gets home

One day I was walking down the street there was a little mole I picked it up and took it home it had caught its leg in a trap and broken it it got better in a few weeks time but I set it free after a few days
It came back I built it a hutch with a lot of mud and grass
It liked that place very much I tried to find anther mole I found one it was quite big I did not know whether it was a male or a female but put them together they did not fight after a few months she has some babies four little ones they were very sweet and they never wanted to leave me and hutch I built for them I gave them worms and water and a few breadcrumbs it never ate very much at all they lived nicely in their little hutch until they all died of old age

I am writing a story about what I do in the summer Holiday when it is hot I go swimming and when it isn't so hot I go to find some wild insects last year I had some frogspawn
I have some every year and only a few die
It is quite hard to find a place for I keep my frog spawn underneath the tank where I it is very cool it takes about 3 months to get ? first they get long then they grow their fins and after a few weeks they get bigger and bigger
but last year there wasn't very many eggs around I went to the moat first there weren't any there so I went down the lane but near the white bridge there was only about 50 eggs
I got down and picked them up with my hands and put them in a big jar with some sea weed they must have a large tin or a large jar not a small thing otherwise when the tadpoles grow they have not much room to move I use a big paint tin to put my frog spawn in and when they get to be frogs and at the end of my garden their is a stream I climb down the back and tip the frogs in the water and you can just watch them swim away
It is best to tip the frogs away when they just lose their tail then you know they will live and just one other thing you must keep them clean and their sea weed every week and they will like a bit of rough meat to chew and that will keep them alive

as I read my letter on a cool afternoon with the window open a sort of breeze swirling round my neck gives me a sort of an refreshing I still keep on reading my letter until I came to the end then I kept on staring down in the letter until someone made a noise then I came of a sort of a dream I just stood there looking out of the window the breeze started to get stronger until it did not feel like a breeze it became dark I could her the curtains started to swing in the wind I felt a bit sleepy so I just closed my eyes for a moment and opened them again then I felt I was different from other people

Once upon a time there was an old lady she was very wicked when the milk man came she did not say thank you she just said get out of here and shut the gate
she was very snooty

` Oh no I did not' `I know you did' alright I did it then what if I did It was to get my own back on you'
`Very sorry I won't do it again' well this time you can have the biscuits but if you do it again you'll be in trouble Oh thank you very much

The ? is very cold The sun is very warm When it is very hot You see people on the shore If you lay on the sand with your eyes closed you can hear people play and talk and the rustle of the sea going out and coming in soon the wind coming very fast I feel a shiver on my bare back the sun has gone behind the clouds everyone starts to go they know there's a storm coming up they get all their things together and go I don't mind storms it became very windy and cold I put my towel round me and lay very still looking at the clouds but of, course I was dreaming

the mystery castle
One day there were two men they were very greedy and selfish they heard something about a castle
one day in the middle of a big lake they decided to explore it
they did not know it had a witch living in it
they borrowed a rowing boat and sailed right to the middle of the lake and when they got near the castle they saw a signpost sticking up from the water it had beware of this castle there is a horrid old witch the men did not worry about the signpost they just went rowing on when they got nearer to the castle they saw another signpost which had a skeleton the men were a bit frightened of this they didn't know what it meant
they saw four girls in a boat with a cloak and hood and with a mask on their face
their names were the four spy girls they knew how to get in the mystery castle
the girls did not see the men
they hid round the other side
the men did not see what they were doing so they rowed round a little bit until they saw the girls one had disappeared
the men wondered where she had gone the men saw bubbles coming up from the bottom of the lake they knew where one of the girls were at the bottom of the lake trying to find the way in the men made a plan
to try and get there before the girl get there one of the men said they might have a plan how to get into the castle
I will dive down and see where they get in then when they have gone we can go and explore the castle and ourselves there might be some hidden treasure then we will be rich richer then any on the world we can go for a month's holiday in Switzerland we needn't do any work until we die we can booze up
the other man said shut up they can hear you fool O ! shut up yourself you're making as much noise as me watch out someone has heard we better get going otherwise they'll think something fishy alright then will go The girls never knew about the two men they carried on with their work that night the two men went across the lake they knew where the hole is they had their swimming gear
they didn't not like that signpost with the skeleton on it looked a bit creepy a great wind rose it started thunder and lightning the two men were very scared the lake was getting very rough the boat started rock and it got very dangerous the men could not swim so they were very frightened the boat tipped over and the men fell out of the boat and drowned so they never got the treasure nor did the 4 spies it was only a rumour going round
but the castle was a mystery because there was an old lady dead in it the top of the tower She had been dead for 10 years no one knew this thing but the four spies explored the castle again they all went down in the water this time they weren't afraid of anything
they wanted to see if there was a witch living in the mystery castle they went up 3 towers and when they went up the 4 tower there was bats big spider crawling about the girls were a bit frightened they went up the creepy stairs and up the top was a big door with a key on the floor the door was locked one of the girls picked the key up and opened the door she was the bravest one she dared do anything the door was a bit stiff it grated as she opened it
It was absolutely horrified to find someone dead on the floor one of the girls fainted
they went near the old lady and saw it was a witch she had all black on and big finger nails nearly as big as a nail and as sharp as a pin She was as white and shrivelled up the girls left her there they locked the door and took the key with them so that no one will disturb her they never told anyone about this they kept the key for a souvenir and a memory of the mystery castle

I am going to leave school at 15, at Easter, 1962, and I shall work for two years at least before I think about getting a boy
I want to get married at 20, so that I will have about three years to get engaged, and to get to know each other
I want two children, one of each or twins
I also want to live in a bungalow I want a man with lovely black or brown wavy hair not much taller than me
I want a man that likes children and takes them out, and plays with them
Then we will all be able to go out and enjoy ourselves
I shall stop nursing when I get married, after I have had a child, then I may do part-time work
I want to get married in white
I want to go abroad for my honeymoon
For the first summer holiday, I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram

Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands
So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of it until the film was over
the best boyfriend I ever had
his father was posted
and so Stephen left
But we still send letters and postcards to each other
So that we still remember each other

One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee, but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened, and told me to take the baby down to the Police station
So I got ready and set off to the station
Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the Police
They said that they would put up notices about the baby
They let me look after him until someone owned up
A month later
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to, if not they would put it in a home
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few days' time the baby was ours and weren't we pleased
So we all lived happily ever after
The End

One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and taking my friend for a walk
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day

Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the meal

they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true

Because it's night time and dark
Because the wind is wild
Because the two waves are a ring
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and there

They ran away to get married In a little country called Lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother, father, maids, and four children, the eldest, was Jenny who was 18 years of age, she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12, Jenny had a boyfriend who lived a few yards away from her, his name was Johnny he was 20 years of age
Jenny and Johnny wanted to get married , they had known each other for 6 years, and were very much in love
They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a married home
But the only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent, to the marriage
So the two young children decided to run away and get married
So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30
So one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clock and made their way to the station
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast
Soon they were on the train
Now we needn't worry about anything my darling, said Johnny
No we can get a job in London and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said Jenny
yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to London
2 months pass They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got married  in a registry office and after they celebrated until 12 o'clock that night, then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went and rang on Jenny's doorbell first
his father came to the door, and took one look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married that's why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office
so "said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but I do wish you'd told us all because I think you are old enough to be man and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home
you can live here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad, and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch your parents Johnny, and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and celebrated
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl, and they all lived happily ever after

Dear Les,
I hope you are OK
just a few lines to write about our English lesson with Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months
He has taught us how to write good letters, stories, and poems
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years
But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work
Love and best wishes, Judith

After hunger, sex is our strongest instinct and greatest problem, to ensure the continuation of the species, nature decorates the woman with beauty and gives to us males such sensitivity to woman's charms that we can go quite mad in their pursuit
our ancestors played down this sexual impulse
we have stimulated it unwisely with advertisement and display, and have armed it with the doctrine that inhibition is dangerous
Yet inhibition - the control of impulse - is the first principle of civilization

The Blind Date
Once a upon a time there was a boy named Rex
He was handsome and he had black hair
but one night he came downstairs
He went to watch the Television
he got fed up, he went out for a walk and he met Jean his friend
He was so sad that Jean asked him was the matter
He said wants a girlfriend
Jean says she will take him to a girl called audrey  watson who works at the greenhouse in Melton
So after he had met her he said to her alone what are you doing tonight and she said she will have to do a job for her manager
he said well perhaps we'll go to the pictures tomorrow and she said yes I'll be there to meet you
The next day audrey came to his house
Then they were both ready so they set out to go the pictures
When they got to the pictures they saw a lovely picture they say it was a very nice picture but when they came out of the picture
they had an argument

When I leave school I am going to ask my mother and father if I can be a nanny
And if I do I am going to look after little children and when I am 15 or 16 I might even get a boyfriend
But not until then I am going to take my dog for a walk when I get him around the village
My mother father and my brother and I are going to mass tonight because it is Holy obligation
I hope we get a bungalow soon because the house what we're in is a dump
We don't like it
I hope we do because a bungalow is better than a cottage

Bernard is ill in bed and the Doctor is coming to see him on Wednesday Morning he felt sick on the football ground on Saturday afternoon
Our dog Toby has been Excited but it's a very cute dog
I have got a bunk which I sleep in
my brother has a single bed and my mother and father has one too
we he haven't any cats but we used to do we used to have round about 12 but they all disappeared
I should think we will be leaving some time my Mother will be glad when we do leave this cottage we all do we don't know about the dog it might be different for him because he is used to that but never mind he will get used to that as well
We all want to go where our Relatons but my mother doesn't want to go to Leiston but I do I like it very much
I don't now know about my father and my brother but I know that they would like it
There are six in my family counting the dog and the bird
we have a garden and it has only grass on each side Well on the left of the garden was a hole in the middle and there was mice in it down the bottom of it
Well one of the cats meant to go outside but something happens he sees this hole and he puts his paw into the hole and the mice come up a little and they grabbed the cat
then it tried to get away but it was no use it was killed then they all came out and then they all were killed
Then there was my mother and father and I came out of the house that night and saw that the cats were in the hole making a noise but we couldn't do anything about it because it was too late
But have got over it

My mother and father have been married for ten years and they have been happy ever since
When they started to meet
They said shall we go to the pictures and my mother said yes we'll do that said my mother it is a very good idea
But sometimes they have a fight they had a fight last night but they made friends again then when we went out last Saturday afternoon they started to have a fight
My father shouted at my mother and then my mother shouted at my father then when my father went to the meeting we went to finish our shopping

When the children went out to play after dinner Linda and I went on the field and sat down for a bit there were Mary Smith and Linda and I Linda said something (and then I went up to her and got on top of her and so we had a little play fight) but we are still friends with each other
we go together every day
I like her to come to Guildwell some day but she said no she can't there if she could she would come and see me and we would have good fun together and go up to the meadow and climb trees
Went I went on my holiday I had a very nice time we played on the bikes and went shopping and when my Auntie went to work but when she went work Joan and Derek started to have a quarrel but I did not take no notice of them and carried on what I was doing then Joan said something to me but I did take notice of her and then she said I always started a quarrel but when we were friends again
Well on one Saturday when my Uncle decided to go to the pictures with Joan and Derek well when they were in the pictures I was in a room watching Bronco Layne on TV
it was better than watching the film but I mean that Bronco was very good
Well when they came home that night I was still watching the TV
and Derek and Joan came in and said that my Uncle was drunk and Joan said that he nearly got run over and also Joan had guided him back to the house where was safe
Well that same night when we were watching Deadline-midnight my Uncle came in and sat on a chair and watched part of the programme and then came up and switched the TV off and told us to go to bed we ran upstairs and Derek and I went into my bedroom so we stay in the room and I heard someone coming up the stairs so I went and I peeped outside the door and saw that my Uncle was coming up the stairs so I told Derek so we went round the bed and I got on the bed and went straight down stairs and went into the kitchen and told my Auutie but she said that she can't do anything about it so when he came downstairs again we went upstairs to bed
And when I was in bed I listened out for my Uncle because sometimes when he is drunk he comes up to my room door but not always but it stopped me from going to sleep because sometimes he gives me the creeps but before then he very nearly hit Derek and I but I don't know what for and then we went to bed and went to sleep but when they all were asleep my uncle got up and came out of the room and went downstairs I don't know what he was up to but still I kept awake a very long time because I wasn't tired so I stayed awake for a while and when he came upstairs and stood outside my door I got a bit scared because I thought he was going to come in my room so I kept so still and quiet and a bit later he went into his own room and got in bed and went to sleep and he woke my Auntie she was awake for a little while and then she was asleep in a no time and I couldn't go to sleep at all but still I kept awake to listen out for my uncle just in case he came into my room but a bit later on I fell off to sleep and I got nice and warm
Well that's all I can say for now

ROSEMARY I don't suppose you want me any more so I won't come with you any more
BERNARD come off it I love you very much
ROSEMARY do you really love me

Sir,
Mr T says Mr Holbrook is too soft with us by not teaching us spellings
I agree with Mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words difficult but people who get under 40 find words very difficult
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy
William Glebe

Sir,
Mr T says that Mr Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and doesn't teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is absolutely nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them
Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we concentrate , and listen to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world
When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the spellings, and punctuation
Yours faithfully Judith

When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea you're thinking of
Jack O'Malley

we have to work hard, and it takes hard work to write these stories and it very hard when people say he soft on us
Joan Stall

I think Mr T should come and see Mr
Holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a form magazine
Michael Holmes
