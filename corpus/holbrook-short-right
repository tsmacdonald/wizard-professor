THE SICK SOW OF THE ARMY COURT
One day Sergent S M Bullimore told Hut 29 to clean Cynthia's pig sty out
When Hut 29 got there they had to go and get some gas masks because the smell was to strong
When S M Bullimore came to the pig sty the pig was laid out on the floor
when they came back S M Bullimore said what have you been doing to my sow
we have not done anything we had to go and get some gas masks because the smell was too strong
that is only the soap what I wash it with
perhaps he ate some soap
Flogger said shall I go and get the vet
get back in the line before I put you on charge
Flogger said under his breath `go and have a pony run'
what did you say
o nothing sir
go and get some whiskey
okay sir
put some soap in it Flogger said Oswald
OK said Flogger
Flogger went off
a little while after he came with a large soap whiskey
he gave it to S M Bullimore
Then he gave it to the pig
A little while after the pig got up and there beside her were six little pigs
S M Bullimore said that made her better that was not me that was the soap
you are on charge
what did you give her
I gave her some whiskey and soap you gave her that
no I never I sir
you did
that's one thing sir It has made her better

Pigs When young up to being killed for bacon
When they are young you have to wait 3 days then you can inject them for pneumonia diseases
you have make sure they have dry straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a fork in with them because the mother might knock it down and the little pigs might stab themselves
we give them worm powder
that is when they get the worm
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can get out of the way of their mother
some people put a light in with them to keep them warm
you have to make sure that mother has a lot of milk
If she has not got enough milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they can eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts for fattening
they can eat some meal when they get a little bigger
we give them some fattening food called Nomber 2
when you wean that is take them from their mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little ones
fighting
when they are big you have to see about weighing
when they have been weighed and ready to go away to be killed

Billy Bunter was too large So they sent for Him in charge
Him in charge was too thin So they sent for Rin Tin Tin
Rin Tin Tin heart is poor So they sent for Barbra Moore
Barbra Moore was having dinner So they sent for Yule Brinner
Yule Brinner sang too high Then they went to space in the sky

My heart is full of sadness My heart is full of joy It might be my wife Or it might be Helen of Troy

One Saturday I thought I would go to the Races at London
I went on my Royal Enfield
they can go quite fast
this was a Royal Enfield ?
there were some Royal Enfield Racing there as well
I saw a Royal Enfield come first it was like mine
there were the new Japanese Honda
they are very fast and getting quite popular in England
I saw one man come off
he was on a BSA
One man had to go in Hospital because he broke his leg
another man hurt his arm in a sidecar race
I don't think it was much
I saw a sidecar turn right over
the sidecar man was alright but the motorbike Rider was thrown into the crowd
I don't know what happened to him
he was hurt quite bad
the sidecar broke off the motorbike and spun down the track for 7 yards then hit a man who was on the corner and killed him
his hat was blowing down the track
the motorbike caught fire and blew up
the petrol went all over the track but they soon put it out by sand
there was some oil got on the track as well
it made it very slippery
There were quite a few people there because it was a nice dry day
The final race was on
there were 2 Royal Enfield 3 Japanese Honda 1 BSA
3 Triumph
they were on the starting line
Bang they're off
one BSA is still on the starting line the rest are round the bend
I can see one man off
he is on a Triumph
I think a Japanese Honda is in the lead
I think he is going to lead
he's won by 3 yards and a Royal Enfield 2 and a Honda 3
The End

we went over the football field it was quite wet and soon made my toes cold
the grass was quite long now it shone with the dew on it
a field ploughed next to it I think it was done yesterday
on the other side was a hedge
it had a lot of thorns in it
they had cleaned the river and made it very wide for the ducks
there were some potatoes in the water
there were some brussels men sitting in the pathway round a fire
we had to go on to a ploughed field to get round them this made my shoes heavy
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did I but we still went
the dew on the brussels leaves made them like pearls
Mr Holbrook went over the brook first
some were boys going round but only one went
after all the rest went over the tree Gerald nearly went in
one foot touched the water
then we went across the new piece of grass into school
we went and cleaned our shoes with paper
then the bell went for break

A poem A little yellow bird sat on my window sill He hopped
and popped about He whistled he chirped
I tried to catch my little yellow bird but he flew in to the golden yellow sun, O how I wish that was my yellow bird

Apple red and green start are bright The apple trees are tall The leaves are small The apples
fall in autumn time
When you get to the cores inside the cores are pips you throw the cores on the fire to burn then
the boys in our village go in the orchard and climb the trees and pinch them
all then they run away with them
then the earwigs fall out in their pockets
the apples are sweet
the trees are full of apples
some of them are cookers
the apples are so gay hanging on the trees
with the sun on them
no wonder the boys like pinch them

What I am going to do when I leave school
When I leave I want to be a hairdresser in Melton or Tonbury
or I want to work in a shop
I do not want to get married till I am twenty one
When I have children I am going to leave work and the husband has got to like children and take them out
I want twins
and I want four bridesmaids
I want to live in a bungalow
for my holiday I would like to go to Butlins , for a honeymoon I like to go to Scotland

On our table there is a sculpture  model this was made by Mrs Chalmers This is Just like a real thing
this is a model of a boy it is standing on a block wood This was modelled in clay not a whole model Just the Head

Swan upping
When they do this kind of thing they need calmer waters
they have to handle them very carefully They use small Boats people think this is very cruel to catch them and put stamp on their wings, in this picture there is a man carrying one out of the Boat its Wings are tied so that it can not break the man's arms, the swans are delicate things

Poem
one day the sun was out and up the stairs I went
My mother in a temper, I spent my day in bed
for fear of my mother I daren't go near
For fear I didn't get to see the sun,
There she lays So quietly there Waiting for the day People weeping waiting Sighing all the days Their hearts are weeping Crying so Hearts beating so rapidly

LINDA I'm not going out tonight with him, I don't want to see him again
